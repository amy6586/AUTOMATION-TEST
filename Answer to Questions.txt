Question 1:

Answer

I choose the Customer Login Page because is something will definetly will be needed in a regression suite, is important to test it using an existing User ID or Password, I would choose other login options but since this is a test there is not much time to automate the entire login options such, use Social Networks or Forgot Password. 
 
Question 2:

Answer
I choose this approach because the UI is one of the easiest and fastest parts to automate, I would choose to automate the Web Services using Soap UI but I don't have the domain knowledge of the application as well as the Calls available to create the testing suite.

Question 3:

Answer   
I will use Selenium to Automate the UI is compatible with several Languages as well is easy to use  for anyone, but since this page is in Angular JS I had to use a wrapper for the Selenium webdriver named Protractor. Is my first time using it this way.

Question 4:

Answer   
I would create a full set of testing about creating an user from scratch, choose different types of combinations for the profile creation and will create separate tests for different kind of login types.
